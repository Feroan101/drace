# Darkian Scoring

The Darkian score is a heuristic metric representing code health.

It is calculated by comparing:
- Total lines of code
- Number and severity of detected issues

The score is intended as:
- A trend indicator
- A comparison tool between revisions

It is not intended as an absolute measure of quality.
