# Darkian Standards

Darkian Standards are formatting and structural assumptions Drace uses internally.

They are not meant to be universal rules.  
They exist to create predictable visual structure and reduce scanning effort.

## General principles

- Related elements should appear visually grouped
- Vertical structure communicates complexity
- Alignment aids comparison
- Noise should be minimized when meaning is simple

## Examples of standards enforced

- Consistent import grouping
- Assignment alignment for simple state definitions
- Controlled line length with readability as priority
- Predictable block spacing

These standards are configurable but form the baseline expectations of the tool.
