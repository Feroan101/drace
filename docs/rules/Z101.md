# Z101 — Import Order Consistency

## What it targets

Import blocks that mix origins or use inconsistent ordering.

## Why it exists

Imports define a file’s dependency surface.  
Predictable ordering improves orientation and reduces cognitive overhead.

## What it encourages

- Clear separation between standard, third-party, and local imports
- Stable file headers across projects
- Easier dependency auditing

## What it does NOT say

- It does not ban specific modules
- It does not enforce a single universal order
- It does not affect runtime behavior
