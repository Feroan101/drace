# Z200 — Compact Control Blocks

## What it targets

Multi-line control blocks that perform only a single simple action.

## Why it exists

Vertical space implies complexity.  
Unnecessarily expanded blocks suggest structure that does not exist.

## What it encourages

- Honest visual density
- Reduced indentation noise
- Clearer intent for trivial branches

## What it does NOT say

- It does not force one-liners
- It respects line length limits
- It avoids complex logic
