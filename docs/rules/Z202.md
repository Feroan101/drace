# Z202 — Repeated Logic Detection

## What it targets

Semantically similar logic patterns repeated across a file or function.

## Why it exists

Semantic duplication is harder to detect and more dangerous than textual duplication.

## What it encourages

- Early abstraction
- Naming shared intent
- Centralizing behavior before divergence occurs

## What it does NOT say

- It does not force abstraction
- It ignores trivial repetition
- It does not assume refactoring is always required
