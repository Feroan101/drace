# Z222 — High External Coupling

## What it targets

Functions that depend on many external objects or variables.

## Why it exists

High coupling reduces predictability and increases change impact.

## What it encourages

- Explicit dependency passing
- Narrower responsibilities
- Improved reuse potential

## What it does NOT say

- It does not forbid globals
- It allows intentional coupling
- It flags pressure, not failure
