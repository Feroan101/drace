# Z100 — Assignment Alignment

## What it targets

Blocks of simple assignments where related variables are visually misaligned.

## Why it exists

Assignments often introduce or configure state.  
When state is defined together, visual alignment improves scanning speed and comparison accuracy.

## What it encourages

- Treating related assignments as a single unit
- Table-like readability for configuration blocks
- Reduced visual friction during review

## What it does NOT say

- It does not require alignment everywhere
- It ignores complex expressions
- It does not optimize for aesthetics alone
