# Z227 — Hidden Dependencies

## What it targets

Functions that rely on undeclared or implicit external names.

## Why it exists

Hidden dependencies make functions fragile and non-portable.

## What it encourages

- Explicit inputs
- Clear dependency surfaces
- Safer refactoring

## What it does NOT say

- It does not ban all globals
- Constants are allowed
- Built-ins are ignored
