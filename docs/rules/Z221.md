# Z221 — Bloated Functions

## What it targets

Functions with excessive top-level structural blocks.

## Why it exists

Each top-level block adds a mental context switch.  
Too many switches reduce cohesion.

## What it encourages

- Clear functional narratives
- Decomposition by responsibility
- Improved testability

## What it does NOT say

- It does not enforce line limits
- It does not require micro-functions
- It focuses on structure, not size
